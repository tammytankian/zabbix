# zabbix
Repository to share my custom templates

The files here are constantly updated. 

From time to time I go over my templates to see where they can improve and will update them here aftewards.

If you download and feel they miss something, feel free to customize them!

Also, I usually don't add triggers to my templates, as I feel what is a "problem value" is very subjective to each person and business

IMPORTANT: All my templates have been tested on Zabbix 7+ ONLY, so you *may* have to adapt them to your environment, if you are using an older version.
